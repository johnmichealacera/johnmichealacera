# 👋 Hi, I'm John Micheal Acera

I'm a **Software Developer** and **Builder** from the Philippines 🇵🇭

I love creating tools that make education and life easier — especially for small communities, local schools, and real-world users. My journey started with simple games and todo apps, and has grown into building full-stack systems for civic engagement, learning, and local development.

### 🧠 What I’m Working On
- 🤖 Learning FastAI and exploring AI integrations for real-world tools

### 💡 What I Enjoy
- Tinkering with both code and hardware
- Learning how to lead, build, and solve actual problems
